/*:
 **Goal:** Use the right-hand rule to navigate through a complex maze.
 
An algorithm that follows the right-hand rule works well for simple walled puzzles, but you can also use it to solve more complicated puzzles, such as mazes.
 
For this puzzle, walk through the maze in your mind. If you always keep your right hand on the wall, you’ll eventually reach the last gem. Write code that uses the right-hand rule to get through the maze and collect the gem.
 
 1. steps: Start by writing your [pseudocode](glossary://pseudocode), including instructions for what to do when you’re blocked.
 2. Test your pseudocode by walking through it in your mind as you move around the puzzle world.
 3. Write the code to implement your algorithm.
