 **Exercise:** Write your own algorithm to solve the maze.
 
 You've tweaked several algorithms so far; it's time to practice what you've learned and write your own algorithm from scratch. For this challenge, youâ€™ll need to navigate through the puzzle world, collecting all the gems and activating all the switches along the way.
 
 Don't forget your coding best practices, and be sure to break down your code into well-factored functions!
