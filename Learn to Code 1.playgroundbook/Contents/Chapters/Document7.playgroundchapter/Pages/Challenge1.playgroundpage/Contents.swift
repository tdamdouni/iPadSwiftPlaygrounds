 **Challenge:** Implement the most efficient algorithm to collect the gems and activate the switches.
 
 In this challenge, youâ€™ll test your algorithm design skills. There are many different algorithms you could use to solve the puzzle, and many different ways to structure your code.
 
If you're not able to find a solution right away, that's okay! Coding often requires trying different solutions to a problem until you find the one that works best. When you're ready, you can move on to [Learn to Code 2](playgrounds://featured).
