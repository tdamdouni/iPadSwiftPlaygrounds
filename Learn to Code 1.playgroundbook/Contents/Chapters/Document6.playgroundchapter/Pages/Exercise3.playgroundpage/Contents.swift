 **Goal:** Choose the best loop to collect all the gems.
 
This puzzle has six gems and a simple [pattern](glossary://pattern) for your character to follow. The best way to solve this puzzle is to use a [loop](glossary://loop), but which kind? You could use a [``while`` loop](glossary://while%20loop) to keep moving while nothing blocks the way. Or, because you know how many gems there are, you could use a [``for`` loop](glossary://for%20loop) to repeat the pattern a specific number of times.

Sometimes deciding how to solve a coding problem is just a matter of which option feels better to you. When coders are faced with this type of choice, they base their decisions on which option results in a shorter solution or has more possibilities for reuse.
 
 1. steps: Identify the pattern to move from gem to gem.
 2. Choose a type of loop and use it to solve the puzzle.
