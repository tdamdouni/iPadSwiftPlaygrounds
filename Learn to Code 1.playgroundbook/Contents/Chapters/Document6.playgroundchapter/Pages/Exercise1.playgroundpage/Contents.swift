/*:
 **Goal:** Use a loop to keep moving while not on an open switch.
 
This puzzle has a line of switches, with a different number of switches each time the puzzle runs. Instead of making your character walk the entire line, checking each step for a switch to toggle open, you can use a form of [conditional code](glossary://conditional%20code) called a [``while`` loop](glossary://while%20loop).

Just like [`if` statements](glossary://if%20statement), `while` loops allow you to determine when your code will run. A `while` loop runs a code block for as long as a [Boolean](glossary://Boolean) condition is true. When the condition is false, the while loop stops running.
 
1. steps: Choose a Boolean condition for your `while` loop to determine when it will run.
2. Add commands to the `while` block to toggle open all the switches.
