 **Goal:** Use a function, a loop, and a condition to collect gems or activate switches.
 
In this puzzle, every other forward movement might lead to a gem, a switch, or nothing at all. When you run the puzzle, the [wireframes](glossary://wireframe) show the locations where items might appear. To solve the puzzle, you could write lots of [``if`` statements](glossary://if%20statement), but thereâ€™s a better way.

Start by breaking the puzzle into its basic patterns. There are three major paths, each with two possible gem or switch locations.
 
1. steps: Using an `if` statement, define the `collectOrToggle()` [function](glossary://function) to check the contents of a tile.
2. Below your function definition, call `collectOrToggle()` and other commands to solve the puzzle.
