/*:
 **Goal:** Decompose a solution across multiple functions.
 
As you've just learned, it can be very useful to define a function that accomplishes a small task, then [call](glossary://call) that function within another function to accomplish an even bigger task.
 
This practice makes your code more readable, because you can name a function based on its purpose; for example, `turnAround()`. It also simplifies the process of writing code, because after you've written a function to perform a bigger task, you no longer have to think about the individual commands.
 
 1. steps: Run the code to see what happens when `solveRow()` is called.
 2. Tweak the code inside `solveRow()` so that it solves a bigger chunk of the puzzle.
 3. Call `solveRow()` along with other commands to solve the puzzle.
