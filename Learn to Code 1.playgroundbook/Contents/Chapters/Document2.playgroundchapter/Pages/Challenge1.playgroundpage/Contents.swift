 **Challenge:** [Define](glossary://define) a function for a repeating pattern.
 
 In this challenge, there are several gems to collect, and each gem is located next to a switch.
 
 Instead of repeating the same pattern of commands you used in previous puzzles, you can write a new [function](glossary://function) that includes existing commands to handle each gem-and-switch pair.
 
You can name your function anything you like in this challenge. After you've named and defined your function, [call](glossary://call) it by entering its name, just like you've done with all the other functions you've used.
