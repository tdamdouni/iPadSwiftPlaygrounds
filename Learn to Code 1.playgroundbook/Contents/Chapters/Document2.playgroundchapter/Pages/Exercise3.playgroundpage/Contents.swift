/*:
 **Goal:** [Call](glossary://call) functions from other functions.
 
Up to now, the [functions](glossary://function) you've [defined](glossary://define) have only called existing [commands](glossary://command), such as `moveForward()` and `collectGem()`. It doesn't have to be this way, though!

The function *`turnAround()`* directs your character to turn around and face the opposite direction. You can call this function inside another function, *`solveStair()`*, and call `solveStair()` in your code to solve bigger parts of the puzzle. 
 
 This process of breaking a larger problem into smaller pieces is called [decomposition](glossary://decomposition).
 
 1. steps: Define the `solveStair()` function, calling `turnAround()` inside of it.
 2. Call `solveStair()` along with the other functions you need.
 3. Solve the puzzle by collecting all four gems.
