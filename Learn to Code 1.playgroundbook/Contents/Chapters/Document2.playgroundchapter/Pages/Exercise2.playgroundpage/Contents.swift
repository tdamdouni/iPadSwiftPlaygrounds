 **Goal:** Define and use your own function to turn right.
 
In the previous puzzle, you turned right only once, so using three left turns wasn't a problem. But what if you need to turn right more than once? It would be more efficient to put all those left turns into a ``turnRight()`` command that you run multiple times.

Commands like ``turnRight()`` are actually [functions](glossary://function) that perform a body of work. You've already been using functionsâ€”every [command](glossary://command) you've used to this point has actually been a function that we've provided for you.
 
To [define](glossary://define) a function, enter a set of commands between the `{` and  `}` curly braces to give it its behavior.

 1. steps: Tap inside the function body (between the `{` and `}` curly braces).
 2. Enter three `turnLeft()` commands. 
 3. Beneath the function, use existing commands along with `turnRight()` to toggle open the closed switch.
