 **Challenge:** Use a for loop to repeat a rotating pattern.
 
In this challenge, youâ€™ll practice finding repeating patterns. You must activate four switches, moving to each switch from the central point.

Break down the puzzle by figuring out the sequence of [commands](glossary://command) needed for your character to activate the first switch and return to the central point. This is the sequence that repeats, so put the code inside the curly braces.

Can you figure out which extra repeating command will make the repeating [pattern](glossary://pattern) work for all the switches?
