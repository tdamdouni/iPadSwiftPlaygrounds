 **Challenge:** Evaluate options and pick the shortest route.
 
 For the last challenge in this lesson, you’ll make Byte move around in a bigger and more complicated world than you’ve seen up to now. This world has two portal jumps, and there are many possible solutions.
 
 Figure out the shortest route for Byte to pick up the gem and toggle open the switch. You can use one or both of the portals, and you'll need to use the [commands](glossary://command) you've learned up to now. (You might need your [debugging](glossary://debug) skills, too!)
 
 * callout(Tip):
 Want to change your character? Tap on Byte to choose a new look.
