/*:
 **Goal:** Use composition to turn Byte to the right.
 
 Have you noticed there’s no ``turnRight()`` command available to you? If Byte needs to turn right to reach a gem, how can you make that happen?
 
 You sometimes have to solve [coding](glossary://coding) problems by combining existing commands to create a new behavior. This process is called **[composition](glossary://composition)**.
 
 1. steps: Figure out how to turn to the right using only the commands you've used before.
 3. Use composition to turn Byte to the right when needed.
 2. Enter the commands to move Byte to collect the gem.
