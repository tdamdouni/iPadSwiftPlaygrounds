/*:
 **Challenge:** Use any coding construct and pattern you like!
 
For your final `while` loops challenge, toggle open all of the closed switches and collect the gems. Choose from your existing skills to solve the puzzle. 
 
Remember, it’s okay if you don't get it on your first try! Professional coders hardly ever get things right the first time around. Your goal is to write some code and keep tweaking it until it works. Good luck!
