/*:
 **Challenge:** Implement the most efficient algorithm to collect the gems and activate the switches.
 
 In this challenge, youâ€™ll test your algorithm design and implementation skills. There are many different algorithms you could use to solve the puzzle, and many different ways to structure your code. 
 
Try thinking through several different algorithms, testing whether you can add conditional moves at any point to minimize the number of steps it takes to navigate through the puzzle world.
