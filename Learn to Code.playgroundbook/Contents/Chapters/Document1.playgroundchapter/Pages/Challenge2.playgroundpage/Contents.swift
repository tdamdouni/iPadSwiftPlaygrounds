/*:
 **Challenge:** Reorder the commands to debug the code.
 
 In this challenge, you’ll practice your [bug](glossary://bug)-finding skills by finding and rearranging the [commands](glossary://command) that are out of order in the code below.
 
 * callout(Watch out!):
Notice that one of the switches on this map starts out **open**. If Byte toggles that switch **closed**, it's a bug in your code. You need all switches toggled open to complete the challenge.
 
 It's a good idea to run your code every time you make a change, to make sure you’ve located and fixed each bug. Don't worry if you end up trying many times. Making mistakes is actually one of the best ways to learn something new and remember it for a long time!
