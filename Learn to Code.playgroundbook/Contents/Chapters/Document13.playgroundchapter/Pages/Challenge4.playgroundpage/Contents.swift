/*:
 **Challenge:** Use everything you've learned to build your own world.
 
You've learned a huge amount to get to this point, from functions, through conditionals and loops, all the way to complex algorithms. You've mastered Swift basics and learned a new set of world-building [methods](glossary://method).
 
 In this final challenge for Learn to Code, Part 1, put all of your knowledge to the test, and use any methods available to you to build your own world.
 
 Don't forget that you can add your own characters and experts, and build any combination of blocks that you like. Be creative, and have fun!
