/*:
 **Goal:** Use the A* algorithm to escape the maze.
 
 The *A** (pronounced "A star") algorithm improves further over breadth-first search and finds short paths with even less searching.
 
  Because your goal is to find the shortest path, A* uses the current distance traveled combined with the estimated distance to the goal to determine the "cost". The tile with the lowest cost is explored at each stage of the algorithm.
 
 You can use the `manhattanDistance(to:)` method to estimate cost based on the distance to the goal, which returns the sum of the horizontal and vertical distance between the two tiles.
 
 1. Check a tileâ€™s neighboring tiles and add them to a queue.
 
 2. As you go through the queue to get the next tile to check, look for the tile with the lowest cost.
