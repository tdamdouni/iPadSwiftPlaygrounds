**Challenge:** Modify the state of two portals to solve the puzzle.
 
For this challenge, there are lots of gems and switches in the puzzle world, with several portals to teleport through. That means there are lots of ways to solve the puzzle.
 
As you write your code, try different solutions in your head to find the most efficient one. Writing efficient code results in a program that runs faster, which makes people using the app happy, and improves the battery life.
 
Access the portals using `greenPortal` and `orangePortal`.
