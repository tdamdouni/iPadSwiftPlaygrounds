**Challenge:** Toggle the same number of switches as gems collected.
 
For this challenge, toggle the same number of switches on the second platform as the number of gems collected on the first platform.
 
 * callout(Assignment shortcut):
 
     Use the [compound assignment operator](glossary://compound%20assignment%20operator) to add a value to a variable and [assign](glossary://assignment) the new value at the same time.
    
    The two lines of code below actually do the exact same thing, but using `+=` is faster!
        
        gemCounter = gemCounter + 1
        gemCounter += 1

Use your knowledge of variables, [assignment](glossary://assignment), and [comparison operators](glossary://comparison%20operator) to create a solution for this puzzle. Remember, it’s okay if you don't get the solution on your first try! Trying different approaches allows you to learn from your mistakes, giving you a deeper understanding of the code that you write.
