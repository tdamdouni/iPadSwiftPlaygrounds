 At the bottom of this page is an example algorithm that distributes its random guesses based on the smallest possible ship sizes (the first method on the previous page). It works in two ways.
 
 **Guess mode (when no ship is found)**
 1. Keep track of the smallest ship, which takes up two tiles.
 2. Fire at every other tile across the ship, targeting only spaces where the ship could fit.
 3. If you sink the ship, modify your algorithm to target areas where the next smallest ship (three tiles) can fit.
 4. Fire at every third tile, targeting only spaces where the ship could be.
 
 **Target mode (when a ship is found)**
 1. Fire at the tiles around where the ship was hit.
 2. After all of the nearby tiles are targeted and the ship and any neighboring ships are destroyed, return to guess mode.
 
 Keep in mind that this is just one option for writing an algorithm for Battleship; many other options exist. Explore and try to improve your algorithm so you can win in even fewer turns!
