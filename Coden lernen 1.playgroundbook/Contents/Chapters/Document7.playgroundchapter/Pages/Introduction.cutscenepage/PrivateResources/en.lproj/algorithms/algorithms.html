		<div>Algorithms
</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>To start, write an algorithm that moves the car forward until it reaches the parking space.</div>
		<div>An algorithm is a set of rules and instructions you use to solve a problem.</div>
		<div>1 of 9</div>
		<div>For example, a navigation app uses an algorithm to figure out the fastest path to where you want to go.
</div>
		<div>To avoid traffic:
</div>
		<div>Select route with shortest travel time.
</div>
		<div>8 of 9</div>
		<div>3 of 9</div>
		<div>Oops. You still need to tweak your algorithm.</div>
		<div>Compare distances and average speeds.
</div>
		<div>Compare current traffic conditions.
</div>
		<div>A lot of the code you’ve written so far has been instructions to solve problems. In this sense, you’ve been writing algorithms the whole time.</div>
		<div>After turning right, the car should drive forward to go around the building.</div>
		<div>5 of 9</div>
		<div>Now, suppose you need to direct a car around a building to find a parking space.
</div>
		<div>The skill you’re now adding is the process of writing and tweaking code so you can use it in different situations.</div>
		<div>What instructions and rules can you use to move the car around the building?
</div>
		<div>Oops. The algorithm doesn’t tell the car to turn at the end of the building.</div>
		<div>2 of 9</div>
		<div>To move the car around the building, create a rule to repeatedly check whether it is blocked on the right.</div>
		<div>6 of 9</div>
		<div>while !isInParkingSpace {   if isBlockedRight {
      driveForward()
   } else {
      turnRight()
   }
}</div>
		<div>One step at a time</div>
		<div>4 of 9</div>
		<div>while !isInParkingSpace {   driveForward()
}</div>
		<div>If the car is not blocked on the right, it has reached the end of the building and should turn right.</div>
		<div>Start Coding</div>
		<div>7 of 9</div>
		<div>while !isInParkingSpace {   if isBlockedRight {
      driveForward()
   } else {
      turnRight()
      driveForward()
   }
}</div>
