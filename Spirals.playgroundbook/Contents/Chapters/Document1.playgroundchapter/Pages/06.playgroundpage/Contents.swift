/*:
 **Goal:** Create an ellipse.
 
 You now have all the ingredients you need to create trochoids and cycloids, of both the *hypo-* and *epi-* varieties. Your final challenge is to figure out how to draw a very special shape-an [ellipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse).
 
 Although they don't look as exciting as the spirals from the previous pages, ellipses are pretty amazing. All the planets in our solar system move around the sun in elliptical orbits! In fact, the moon, the sun itself, and all the stars you can see in the sky move along their own elliptical paths through the universe.
 
 Are you ready to try making an ellipse of your own? Here's the recipe:
 
 1) The track radius is *exactly twice as long* as the wheel radius.
 2) An ellipse is a special type of *hypotrochoid*.
 3) The spoke length is either greater than or less than the wheel radius.
 
 **Tip:** The ellipse you're seeing in the live view is just one possibility. Yours might be long and thin, or short and fat, or even vertical! Good luck!
