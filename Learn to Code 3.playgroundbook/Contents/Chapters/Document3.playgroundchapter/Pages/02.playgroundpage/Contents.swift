 **Goal:** Get your iPad to speak.
 
 Did you know your iPad can speak? Wouldnâ€™t it be cool to see if it can say a tongue twister better than you can?
 
 Naming a string by defining it as a [constant](glossary://constant) makes it handier to useâ€”or even reuseâ€”in your code.
 
 * callout(Creating a string constant):
    `let twister = "Twelve twins twirled twelve twigs."`\
    `scene.write(twister)`
 
 Here, `twister` is a constant of type `String`, usually just called a string.
 
 Whenever you call `speak()`, the [speech synthesizer](glossary://speech%20synthesis) speaks the string you pass as a parameter.
 
 * callout(Speaking a string):
    `speak(twister)`
 
 In the code, youâ€™ll see several of Bluâ€™s terribly tortuous tongue twisters (try saying that fast ðŸ˜³) as string constants:
 
 1. Add code to speak `twister1` after itâ€™s written to the scene.
 2. Make sure the volume is turned up on your iPadâ€”you wouldnâ€™t want to miss anything!
 2. Run the code and see if your iPad can do better than you can!
