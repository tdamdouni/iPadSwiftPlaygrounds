		<string>
Place a graphic in each quadrant, calculating the (x, y) coordinates for each.\
As an example, get the position of the graphic in the bottom left quadrant:\
`let position3 = Point(x: -x, y: -y)`
		</string>
		<string>
**Idea:** Set the `rotation` and `scale` of each graphic to the same random values:\
`let rotation = randomDouble(from: 0, to: 180)`\
`let scale = randomDouble(from: 0.5, to: 2.5)`
		</string>
		<string>
**Idea:** Make each graphic fade away after a period:\
`graphic.fadeOut(after: 2.0)`
		</string>
		<string>
**Idea:** Move each graphic into position from the touch position:\
`scene.place(graphics[0], at: touch.position)`\
`graphics[0].move(to: position1, duration: 2.0)`
		</string>
