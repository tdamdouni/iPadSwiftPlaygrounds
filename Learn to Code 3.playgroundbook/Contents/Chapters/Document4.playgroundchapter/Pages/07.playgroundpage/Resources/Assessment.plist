### Looks like you‚Äôve earned your UFF Squisher badge!

**Challenge:** Try making some fruits harder to destroy. A fructoid graphic is created with an emoji, so you can just compare its `text` property like this: `if graphic.text == "üçè"`. If you reduce the `scale` and `alpha` values by less, you‚Äôll need more touches to zap the fruit.

On the [**next page**](@next), you‚Äôll learn how to use a single button to squish all the UFFs at the same time!
